              How to Prevent Spider Infestations
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary way for spider entry is via building gaps like
              windows, doors, and under the main gate. The best way to prevent
              spider infestation is to avoid spiders entering the home. Routine
              cleaning of the home, garden, garage, and kitchen is crucial.
              Never leave belongings on the floor for a long time. Spiders can
              be easily trapped using a glass jar and then discarded outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              When lights are not in use, switch them off. All insects,
              especially spiders, can be easily attracted and enter the home.

              of professionals to get rid of spiders at home or office in
